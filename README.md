# Square Tale (OLD)

So, this is a game called Square Tale that i made in 1 hour. It is an old project from a year ago and i have plans to revive it.

It's a 2d "platformer" local multiplayer arcade shooter that is not balanced nor good. I used it mainly to learn new things. Now, as i said, i am planning
to make a "remaster" of the game, this time with an in-game economy, online multiplayer, different weapons and a bunch more.

## Installation

To install this old rusty game, first open cmd(or bash on linux) and run:

'pip install pygame==2.0.1'

After that, run main.py and you will be set!

## When is the remake going to come out?

I am not working on it currently, but i really want to make this game a reality!
Looking forward to late 2023.
